  Todo: Declaration function names to start with Decl?
  Todo: Local and parameters:  read and write need immeadiate or direct indication (ld r0,a or ld r0,#a.
  Todo: Local and parameters:  read before set warnings.
  Todo: No concept of alignmnent. All vars occupy their own size and no packing is generated.
  Todo: void Foo(void). Parameters display incorrectly.
  Todo: Subtraction of arrays looks odd. Debug and comment the code.
  ToDo: C-parsing expression optimisation could be skipped and left for the optimizer?
  ToDo: Array, arrow and dot could be translated to arithmetic?

      **** GenDataObjectEnum(): improvement. Comment could be the enum symbol name?
  ExprOptimize.c
      OptimizeTernary(): Needs to be optimized.
      OptimizeDotExpr(): Needs to be optimized.
      OptimizeArrowExpr(): Needs to be optimized.
      OptimizeArrayExpr(): Needs to be optimized.
      OptimizeAssign(): Needs to be optimized.
      **** ExprOptimize(): Could do better!
  Expr.c
      ExprMakeConstS: Should flag the contents as constant.
  Optimize And
  Optimize Or
  Optimize Xor
      **** should we change the node's type here?
